                Every section here exists because of a memory,
                a smile, or a moment that stayed longer than it should have.

                Happy Birthday.
                I hope this reminds you how loved you are,
                even on the days I forget to say it properly.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <p>I know I dont always say the right things at the right time,
                and sometimes I hide behind jokes or silence.
                But every little detail here is something I noticed about you,
                something I didnt want to forget.

                This isnt perfect.
                Neither am I.
                But its real, and its yours.

            <p> No matter where life takes us,
                Im always rooting for you.
                Even on the days you dont see it.
                I hope this made you smile,
                even a little.
                That was the whole point.
                You know how you always said that youre bday was never celebrated well... 
                Well ig with anaya, yashvi and my efforts. its worth it. I used a lot of help from youtube videos. 
                And a lot of effort went into this and whatever anaya and yashvi will give. I hope that this bday is different. 
                Maybe something memorable. Thank you for staying w me. Thanks. im being informal here as theres is nothing i can think of anymore. 
                im not the shakespeare final boss like you yk. Welp- I love you A lot 
                If you ever forget how special you are,
                come back here.
                This exists for a reason.
                This website will stay the same.
                Youll keep growing.
